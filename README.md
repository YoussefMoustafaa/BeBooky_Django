# BeBooky: Online Library System

BeBooky is a full-stack online library platform designed for general users to browse, borrow, and return books. Admins have the ability to manage books in the library, including adding, updating, and removing books. Users can view available books, borrow them, and return them once they’re finished.
## Features

  * Admin Panel: Admins can add, update, or remove books from the library.
  * User Interaction: Users can browse, search, borrow, and return books easily.
  * Search Feature: Users can search for books by author or book name.
  * Category Filters: Users can filter books by categories for easier navigation.
  * User Authentication: Secure login and registration for both admins and users.

## Tools Used

  * Backend: Django
  * Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  * Database: SQLite (default)

## Setup Instructions

  1. Install Django: Ensure that Django is installed on your local machine. You can install it using pip:

bash```pip install django```

  2. Clone the Repository:

bash```git clone [repository-link]
cd BeBooky```

  3. Migrate the Database:
    Run the following command to set up the database:

  4. Run the Development Server:

  5. Access the Website:

## How It Works

  * Admin Role: Admins can manage books (add, update, delete) through a simple interface.
  * User Role: Users can browse available books, search for specific titles by author or name, filter by categories, and borrow or return books when needed.

## Future Enhancements
